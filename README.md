# Models
## Linear regression
* [linear regression using normal equation](./linear-regression-normal-equation.py)
* [linear regression with SGD](./linear-regression.py)
* [linear regression with polynomial kernel](./polynomial-regression.py): linear regression with `polynomial kernel` aka `polynomial regression`.
* [linear regression with OOP](./linear-regression-fancy.py): simple example how to organize code with classes. 

## Logistic regression
* [logistic regression](./logistic-regression.py) trained on `obligatory` MNIST.

# Infrastructure and Debugging
## Tensorboard
* [minimal example](./minimal-tensorboard.py)
* [logistic regression with train and validation split](./logistic-regression.py): validation and training error plotted on the same graph. 

## Pipelines
* [custom datastructures](./pipelines/pipeline-simple.py): MNIST as a custom dataset
